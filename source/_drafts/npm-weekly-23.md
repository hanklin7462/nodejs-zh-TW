## big numbers are big

Holy wah, you’ve been busy. Last week, the npm community

*   broke the record of downloads for each day of the week, every single day;
*   broke the all-time record for daily downloads;
*   broke the all-time record for highest rate of requests;
*   achieved 1.9 billion monthly downloads;
*   achieved 170,000 packages in the npm registry.

If you don’t [follow Laurie on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=seldo), you’ve missed more amazing stats-’n’-graphs. See, e.g., [npm requests per region, and the resulting global traffic graph](https://twitter.com/seldo/status/625777632089542657).

## …and speaking of numbers

We frequently get questions about npm’s download stats — what do and don’t we count?, are an author’s package download counts “real”?… — so here’s a detailed post for the curious: [how npm download counts work](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/92574016600/numeric-precision-matters-how-npm-download-counts?utm_campaign=newsletter20150804).

## did you know?

If you’re having trouble using a module, try `npm owner ls`.

It’s a one-step way to find a module’s contributor so you can get in touch. Also, `npm bug` will open the GitHub issues page in a new browser window.

And of course, if you’re having trouble installing a module from our registry, we’re always here to help: [support@npmjs.com](mailto:support@npmjs.com).
