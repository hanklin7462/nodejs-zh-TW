## how to mail selfies to your mom

![if only there were some kind of stick, for selfies](https://partners.npmjs.com/weekly/weekly28/presidential-selfie-900x.jpg "if only there were some kind of stick, for selfies")

Russell at [lob.com](https://lob.com/ "Lob - APIs for Print, Mail, Postcards, Photos, & Letters") wrote an in-depth tutorial that shows how to build an [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express "express") app that prints and mails a postcard of any of your Instagram photos. It’s _fantastic_.

We highly recommend checking out [the tutorial](https://lob.com/blog/building-an-instagram-postcard-app-in-express-js/ "Build an Instagram Postcard App with Express.js + Lob") and [a working demo](http://demos.lob.com/instagram/ "Instagram + Lob Postcards"). a) It’s fun to build something cool, and b) This is the kind of tutorial we hope will proliferate within the npm community. Give it a whirl and let us know how it goes.

(Our address is 1999 Harrison Street, ste. 1150, Oakland, CA 94612, USA, by the way. Oh, no reason.)

## how not to sound like a jerk

[![](https://partners.npmjs.com/weekly/weekly28/enigma-900x.jpg "Alex - Catch insensitive, inconsiderate writing")](http://alexjs.com "Alex - Catch insensitive, inconsiderate writing")

Odds are none of us intends to exclude or hurt fellow members of the community, but polarizing and gender-favoring language has a way of slipping into what we write. Sometimes it’s a big help to have a second set of eyes that can look things over, notice what we’ve overlooked, and nudge us towards being more considerate and inclusive.

Check out [alex](http://alexjs.com "Alex - Catch insensitive, inconsiderate writing"), which helps “catch insensitive, inconsiderate writing” by identifying possibly offensive language and suggesting helpful alternatives.
