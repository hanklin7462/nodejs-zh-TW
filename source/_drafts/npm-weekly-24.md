## who <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">moved my cheese</span> put a caret (^) in my package.json?

When you execute `npm install` in a clean project directory, package.json specifies the version of each dependency that gets installed. But npm makes it possible to specify a range of accepted versions instead of exact version numbers.

If this sounds a) awesome and b) worth understanding in detail, we highly recommend [this neat ByteArcher explainer on Semver](http://bytearcher.com/articles/semver-explained-why-theres-a-caret-in-my-package-json/ "Semver explained - why there's a caret (^) in my package.json?").

## awesome videos for learning all the things

The [Cyberwizard Institute](http://cyber.wizard.institute/ "Cyberwizard Institute") is an open, collaborative, and free programming school based out of Oakland’s [Sudo Room hackerspace](http://sudoroom.org/ "Sudo Room | Creative community and hackerspace"). They’ve got [a nice workshop on using npm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IRNyMdYD0 "Cyber Wizard Institute: npm and using npm modules - YouTube"), and many many more helpful videos [on their YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzDHOdHNitu70iiva25rV7w "Cyber Wizard Institute  - YouTube").

## two ways to help npm!

How do you improve upon perfection? One way to find out. Actually, two!:

### schedule a usability session

As part of our ongoing focus on making developers’ lives easier, we need your help participating in [a 30-minute usability session](https://calendly.com/npm/ux "Calendly - Nick Cawthon") with **Nick Cawthon**, our new head of design & UX. Laugh, cry, screenshare — and help us improve our product.

### help us test Orgs

Coming this fall, **Orgs** will streamline the process for delegating permissions, managing roles, and collaborating with your team on publishing and sharing packages. But first, we need a small number of teams to help with testing and feedback. If you and your team would like early access to our newest feature, [sign up here](http://info.npmjs.com/test-orgs?utm_campaign=newsletter20150813 "help us test npm Orgs") to help out.

## new humans

Oh geez, we’re still growing.

*   [Aria Stewart](https://twitter.com/aredridel "Aria Stewart (@aredridel) | Twitter") joins our www team remotely from Boston via PayPal, where she worked extensively on Kraken.
*   [Nick Cawthon](https://twitter.com/ncawthon "Nick Cawthon (@ncawthon) | Twitter") joined this week to run design & UX. He laid out his plans [on our blog](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/126455035030/hello-and-lets-talk?utm_campaign=newsletter20150813 "The npm Blog — Hello... and Let’s Talk").
*   Back in the day, [Jon Cowperthwait](https://twitter.com/cowperthwait "Cowperthwait (@cowperthwait) | Twitter") worked with CTO Laurie at [awe.sm](https://web.archive.org/web/20140405115445/http://totally.awe.sm/about/#~pl6jScfWfv3hr7 "awe.sm | About awe.sm"); now he’s here to help Kasey market all the things.

## looking for work?

If you’re not doing Node.js in your job, and you’d like to be, get a load of [these companies looking for JavaScript and Node.js developers](https://www.npmjs.com/whoshiring?utm_campaign=newsletter20150813 "Who’s Hiring? | npm"). (_Have companies to add to this list? email [whoshiring@npmjs.com](mailto:whoshiring@npmjs.com)!_)

## big numbers are big, cont’d

Holy wah, a new record: in the last 30 days, [npm users have downloaded over **2 billion packages**](https://twitter.com/seldo/status/631289016101441537 "Laurie Voss on Twitter: "npm users have downloaded over 2 billion packages in the last 30 days: http://t.co/9IWGbwZqNZ""). Also: in the 20 months since npm, Inc. started, the registry got 300% bigger, and registry traffic has grown 1100%.

## have an idea for the Weekly?

We love hearing from you. Just [drop us a note](mailto:jec@npmjs.com) with your suggestions for the Weekly and heads-ups of what’s up.

## hungry?

Of the 173,288 (and counting!) packages on the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/?utm_campaign=newsletter201508113 "npm"), this is possibly the most edible. Here’s a fun package for ordering pizza from Domino’s: [npm: dominos](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dominos "dominos").
