## npm is at Open Source & Feelings

It’s a light Weekly this week because a good chunk of our humans are at [Open Source & Feelings](http://osfeels.com "Open Source & Feelings"). If you are, too, we have three requests:

1.  Say hi. [Isaac](https://twitter.com/izs "lake merrittocracy (@izs) | Twitter"), [Laurie](https://twitter.com/seldo "Laurie Voss (@seldo) | Twitter"), [Aria](https://twitter.com/aredridel "Aria Stewart (@aredridel) | Twitter"), [Ernie](https://twitter.com/ehsalazar "Ernie Salazar (@ehsalazar) | Twitter"), [Forrest](https://twitter.com/othiym23 "Forrest L Norvell (@othiym23) | Twitter"), [Jeff](https://twitter.com/jefflembeck "Jeff Lembeck (@jefflembeck) | Twitter"), [Kat](https://twitter.com/maybekatz "Kat Marchán (@maybekatz) | Twitter"), and [Rebecca](https://twitter.com/ReBeccaOrg "Rebecca v7.3.2-beta1 (@ReBeccaOrg) | Twitter") are around, and make for good conversation.
2.  [![](https://partners.npmjs.com/weekly/weekly31/eeeee.jpg "eeee")](https://partners.npmjs.com/weekly/weekly31/eeeee.jpg "eeeeee")See Isaac speak. **Saturday at 12:30pm**, he’ll present _Non-Violent Communication for Fun, Profit, and Self Defense_:

    > Turn conversations away from blame and antagonism, towards meaningful connection and opportunities for growth and collaboration

    It’s a profoundly important toolkit when collaborating with others in the open source community, because

    > Open source is a social machine, and compassion helps keep the gears from grinding to a halt.

    Check it out.
3.  Show us your laptop. The OSFeels swagbag includes an OSFeels-exclusive Wombat sticker from [Jon Q](https://twitter.com/itsjonq). Stick it on, snap a pic, tweet it with the hashtag **#wombatlove**, and good things will come to you.

## npm is getting faster

It wasn’t much of a secret that the first versions of npm 3 have been … slower than we like. In one typical example, `npm ls` in npm 2 on a MacBook took around 5 seconds; the same command in npm 3 was closer to 00:50.

Good news, by which we mean great news: in [npm 3.3.6](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v3.3.6 "Release v3.3.6 · npm/npm"), we’ve made huge strides at tuning performance to get things sped back up. We found one example of something going from _6 minutes_ down to _14 seconds_. Rebecca [gently suggests](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v3.3.6 "Release v3.3.6 · npm/npm"):

> Performance just got 5 bazillion times better.

Yooge.

3.3.6 is `next` at the moment, and `latest` next week. Let us know how it goes.

## npm is part of NewCo Oakland

[![](https://partners.npmjs.com/weekly/weekly30/newco-1100x.jpg "NewCo Oakland Festival 2015")](http://oak.newco.co/schedule-2015/ "NewCo Oakland Festival 2015")

## npm modules are demoed in the browser

[![](https://partners-staging.npmjs.com/weekly/weekly31/npm_connected.gif "Tonic: a better REPL for node.js")](https://tonicdev.com "Tonic: a better REPL for node.js")

If you’ve ever used [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net "Create a new fiddle - JSFiddle") to try out or demonstrate JavaScript snippets online, you’re gonna dig [Tonic](https://tonicdev.com "Tonic: a better REPL for node.js").

Tonic lets you `require()` any module in npm and run it right in your browser, which comes in handy for blog posts, docs, teaching, or just more easily showing off cool things.
